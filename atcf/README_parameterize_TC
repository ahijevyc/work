adeck_HollandB_scale_Vmax_balance_Pmin
    Start with ECMWF ensemble adeck vitals.
    Run aswip. Then use Holland B and Vmax to derive balanced minimum pressure with ~bin/holland_pmin.py.
    Scale ensemble Vmax so its mean equals the OFCL forecast at each time

adeck_scale_Vmax_HollandB_balance_Pmin
    Start with ECMWF ensemble adeck vitals.
    Scale ensemble Vmax so its mean equals the OFCL forecast at each time
    Run aswip. Then use Holland B and Vmax to derive balanced minimum pressure with ~bin/holland_pmin.py.

origmesh_scale_Vmax_HollandB_balance_Pmin
    Replace ECMWF ensemble adeck vitals from vitals from gridded forecast.
    Remove times with no gridded ECMWF data
    Scale ensemble Vmax so its mean equals the OFCL forecast at each time
    Run aswip. Then use Holland B and Vmax to derive balanced minimum pressure with ~bin/holland_pmin.py.

origmesh.scaled_Vmax.balanced_Pmin.delta_adjusted_Pmin
    Replace ECMWF ensemble adeck vitals from vitals from gridded forecast.
    Remove times with no gridded ECMWF data
    Scale ensemble Vmax so its mean equals the OFCL forecast at each time
    Give aswip original mesh vitals. Output Holland's B.
    Holland's B and original mesh Vmax -> ~/bin/holland_pmin.py -> Pmin0
    Give aswip original mesh vitals, but now with scaled Vmax. Output Holland's B.
    Holland's B and original mesh scaled Vmax -> ~/bin/holland_pmin.py -> Pmin1
    Pmin1 - Pmin0 = delta 
    Add delta to original mesh Pmin.
